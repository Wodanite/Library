This is my first project of the JavaScript module of The Odin Project.
I will build a library app which stores books and data about the books.
The aim of this project is to learn how to use objects to organize JS code.

What I learned:
*How to use object constructors
*How to build a table dynamicly with JS
*Using overflow:hidden and overflow:auto
*Using innerHTML in a secure way to prevent scripting attacks
